# Getting Started with Vite

This project uses [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) for a fast and modern development experience.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`
(or `npm run dev`)

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Runs the test suite in watch mode.\
Tests will automatically re-run when you make changes to your code.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `dist` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the Vite documentation for more information about [building for production](https://vitejs.dev/guide/build.html).

### `npm run preview`

Locally preview the production build.\
This command will start a local server to serve the built files from the `dist` folder.
